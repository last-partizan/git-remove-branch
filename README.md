![Screenshot](docs/images/screenshot.png)

1. Move to `~/.local/bin` or whatever dir you're using for executable scripts.
2. You can use it as is, or add this to your git config and use as `git rmb`:

It's also available as `git remove-branch`, without adding alias.

```
[alias]
	rmb = "!git-remove-branch"
```
